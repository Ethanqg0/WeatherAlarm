    Schedule and execute a daily weather update task.

    This function uses the `schedule` library to schedule a daily task that sends 
    a weather update to clients at 08:00 AM. The weather update is obtained by 
    calling the `send_weather_update` function with the list of
    clients obtained from the `get_clients` function.

    The function runs indefinitely, continuously checking for pending scheduled 
    tasks and sleeping for one second between checks.
